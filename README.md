# 2019-illinois-capital-bill
In early July 2019, the State of Illinois enacted a package of legislation to fund transportation capital projects, water infrastructure,
natural resources and open space projects, and the construction of schools, affordable housing, and other facilities. Appropriations for
the capital package are found in multiple pieces of legislation that were passed together at the end of the General Assembly’s spring
session. The majority of the funded projects and programs are located within one piece of legislation, Public Act 101-0029, which is
publicly available as a PDF. Within the document there are more than 1,400 line-item appropriations written in paragraph form which
include the fund source, the department responsible for administering the appropriation, and a brief description of the project or
program. Though the document is searchable, the text format makes viewing more than one appropriation at a time difficult.  

Of particular interest to CMAP was the ability view and summarize appropriations by project topic, bond fund, and geography. For example,
finding answers to questions like: how much funding was allocated out of the new Multi-Modal Bond Fund and will be made available to
transit in the region? Or how do appropriations for geographically specific projects compare to funds that will be made available 
statewide? To answer questions like these and to better understand the types of projects and programs funded as part of the capital
package, CMAP staff used free open-source statistical software to convert the Public Act into a data table that can be explored and
summarized in Excel. The data table is available to download as a CSV below and the R code used to translate the bill can be accessed
on CMAP’s Github page. 

The projects and programs funded in Public Act 101-0029 do not represent all capital projects funded in the package passed by the General
Assembly, nor are they guaranteed to move forward. Appropriations, particularly for bond-funded projects backed by new sources of
revenues, are contingent on the state issuing the bonds and realizing the projected level of new revenues. Additionally, while many
specific projects are included as line items, other line items are for broad categories of project types and specific projects to be
funded will be decided at a later date; the list is therefore not exhaustive of all projects to be funded by the capital package.
With this in mind, we encourage our partners to download the data, run the R code, explore the projects and programs in the legislation,
and let us know what you find @onto2050.
